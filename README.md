# hitchinbitches
A web app for a local chapter of Hitchin' Bitches (read more at http://senseshibari.com/). Contact mary if you want to contribute. Stack will be MERN with Redux and will be mobile friendly.

The focus or intent of this app is to support the coordinators and volunteers in a chapter as they create events, create curriculum and workshops and assign volunteers with appropriate skillsets to teach. We will be drawing from Topologists data on ties to identify skills and users will also be able to manage profiles with the skills they have and skills they are able to teach others.
